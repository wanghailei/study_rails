# Turbo

==% 有 Turbo，可以讓 UI 局部刷新，且不用寫 Javascript。20231129 %==

Turbo speeds up Rails applications, reduces the amount of JavaScript we have to write, and makes it easy to work with real-time features.

1\. All clicks on links and form submissions are now AJAX requests, thanks to Turbo Drive. We get this benefit for free as it does not require any work; we only have to import the library.

2\. It is now effortless, with just a few lines of code to build dynamic applications by slicing pages in different pieces with Turbo Frames. We develop our CRUD controllers just like we did before, and just by adding a few lines of code, we can replace or lazy-load independent parts of the page!

3\. It becomes trivial to add real-time features with the help of Turbo Streams. Want to add real-time notifications to your application, build a real-time multiplayer game, or a real-time bug monitoring system? The real-time part is just a few lines of code with Turbo Stream!
