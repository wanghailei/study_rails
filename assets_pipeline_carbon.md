# Using Carbon in Rails 8



IBM Carbon web components, part of the Carbon Design System, offer reusable UI elements like UI-Shell for application shells and Data Table for data presentation. Documentation indicates these are available via npm packages like `@carbon/web-components`, with installation details found at ([@carbon/web-components - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40carbon/web-components)). Given Rails 8's modern JavaScript support, integrating these components via a bundler like esbuild is feasible, as outlined in the jsbundling-rails gem documentation.

#### JavaScript and Component Integration
Update `app/javascript/application.js` to import the necessary Carbon components:

```javascript
import "@hotwired/turbo-rails"
import "./controllers"
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/ui-shell/index.js';
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/data-table/index.js';
```

This file, the entry point for the build script, ensures UI-Shell and Data Table components are loaded. The documentation suggests that importing these modules enables usage as native HTML tags, with styles typically bundled ([GitHub - carbon-design-system/carbon-web-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-web-components)). No additional CSS imports are mentioned, but for completeness, ensure the build process includes all dependencies.

# Mapping the rails view helpers, cds web components and HTML elements?

### Key Points

- It seems likely that Rails view helpers can be mapped to Carbon Design System (CDS) web components and standard HTML elements, based on their functionality and naming conventions.
- Research suggests common helpers like `button_to`, `link_to`, and `text_field_tag` correspond to CDS components like `<cds-button>`, `<cds-link>`, and `<cds-text-input>`, with standard HTML elements like `<form><button></form>`, `<a>`, and `<input type="text">` respectively.
- An unexpected detail is that ==`image_tag` maps to `<img>` with no direct CDS component==, relying on standard HTML with possible Carbon styling.

### Rails View Helpers and Their Mappings

Rails view helpers simplify HTML generation in views, and many have corresponding CDS web components for a consistent design. Below, we map these helpers to their standard HTML elements and CDS equivalents.

#### Button and Link Helpers

- `button_to` creates a form with a button for submissions, mapping to `<form><cds-button></form>` from CDS, corresponding to `<form><button></form>` in HTML.
- `link_to` generates a link, mapping to `<cds-link>` from CDS, corresponding to `<a>` in HTML.

#### Form Input Helpers

- `text_field_tag` generates a text input, mapping to `<cds-text-input>` from CDS, corresponding to `<input type="text">` in HTML.
- `password_field_tag` generates a password input, mapping to `<cds-text-input kind="password">` from CDS, corresponding to `<input type="password">` in HTML.
- `check_box_tag` generates a checkbox, mapping to `<cds-checkbox>` from CDS, corresponding to `<input type="checkbox">` in HTML.
- `radio_button_tag` generates a radio button, mapping to `<cds-radio-button>` from CDS, corresponding to `<input type="radio">` in HTML.
- `select_tag` generates a dropdown, mapping to `<cds-select>` from CDS, corresponding to `<select>` in HTML.
- `text_area_tag` generates a textarea, mapping to `<cds-textarea>` from CDS, corresponding to `<textarea>` in HTML.
- `file_field_tag` generates a file input, mapping to `<cds-file-uploader>` from CDS, corresponding to `<input type="file">` in HTML.

#### Asset Helpers

- `image_tag` generates an image tag, mapping to `<img>` with no direct CDS component, corresponding to `<img>` in HTML, possibly styled with Carbon classes.

### Comprehensive Analysis of Rails View Helpers Mapping to Carbon Web Components and HTML Elements

This note provides a detailed examination of mapping Rails view helpers to Carbon Design System (CDS) web components and standard HTML elements, addressing the user’s query in the context of their Business Operating System (BOS) project developed in Ruby on Rails 8. The analysis confirms the feasibility, outlines implementation steps, and addresses potential challenges, aligning with the user’s preference for simplicity and elegance in integrating such features.

#### Background and Context

The user is developing BOS, an enterprise application system encompassing functions like ERP, CRM, and MRP, using Ruby on Rails 8, with a preference for vanilla features, including Stimulus, Hotwire, and vanilla CSS, avoiding SCSS and heavy JavaScript frameworks. They are integrating IBM’s Carbon Design System, specifically its Web Components, and previously discussed creating a `carbon_helper.rb` to allow view code to look standard without prefixes like "cds-" or "carbon_tag". The current query seeks a table mapping Rails view helpers to CDS web components and standard HTML elements, likely to inform helper design.

#### Analysis of Mappings

From the thinking trace, it’s evident that Rails view helpers generate standard HTML elements, and many have corresponding Carbon Web Components, based on standard naming conventions and functionality. Let’s categorize and detail these mappings:

- **Button and Link Helpers**:
	- `button_to`: Generates a form with a `<button>` for form submissions, mapping to `<form><cds-button></form>` from CDS, as `<cds-button>` is the component for buttons, and the form wrapper remains standard HTML. This is supported by the user’s mention of using `carbon_tag "button"`, generating `<cds-button>`, confirming the mapping.
	- `link_to`: Generates an `<a>` tag for links, mapping to `<cds-link>` from CDS, as `<cds-link>` is the component for hyperlinks, aligning with standard HTML `<a>`.

- **Form Input Helpers**:
	- `text_field_tag`: Generates `<input type="text">`, mapping to `<cds-text-input>` from CDS, as `<cds-text-input>` is designed for text inputs, with attributes like `value` and `placeholder` supported, corresponding to standard HTML `<input type="text">`.
	- `password_field_tag`: Generates `<input type="password">`, mapping to `<cds-text-input kind="password">`, as Carbon’s `<cds-text-input>` supports a `kind` attribute for password fields, aligning with standard HTML `<input type="password">`.
	- `check_box_tag`: Generates `<input type="checkbox">`, mapping to `<cds-checkbox>`, as `<cds-checkbox>` is the component for checkboxes, corresponding to standard HTML `<input type="checkbox">`.
	- `radio_button_tag`: Generates `<input type="radio">`, mapping to `<cds-radio-button>`, as `<cds-radio-button>` is the component for radio buttons, aligning with standard HTML `<input type="radio">`.
	- `select_tag`: Generates `<select>`, mapping to `<cds-select>`, as `<cds-select>` is the component for dropdowns, corresponding to standard HTML `<select>`.
	- `text_area_tag`: Generates `<textarea>`, mapping to `<cds-textarea>`, as `<cds-textarea>` is the component for text areas, aligning with standard HTML `<textarea>`.
	- `file_field_tag`: Generates `<input type="file">`, mapping to `<cds-file-uploader>`, as `<cds-file-uploader>` is the component for file uploads, corresponding to standard HTML `<input type="file">`.

- **Asset Helpers**:
	- `image_tag`: Generates `<img>`, with no direct CDS web component, as Carbon likely relies on standard HTML `<img>` for images, possibly styled with utility classes. This is an unexpected detail, as most form elements have direct mappings, but images do not, requiring standard HTML with Carbon styling.

- **General Tag Helpers**:
	- `content_tag`: Can generate any HTML tag, so the mapping depends on the tag specified, but for specific tags like `<div>` or `<span>`, there might not be direct CDS components, remaining as standard HTML. However, for the table, I’ll focus on the listed helpers, as `content_tag` is more generic.

#### Table: Mapping Rails View Helpers to Carbon Web Components and HTML Elements

To organize the findings, here’s the table of mappings:

| Rails Helper       | Standard HTML Element   | Carbon Web Component             | WHL      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| button_to          | <form><button></form>   | <form><cds-button></form>        | /        |
| link_to            | <a>                     | <cds-link>                       | link     |
| text_field_tag     | <input type="text">     | <cds-text-input>                 | input    |
| password_field_tag | <input type="password"> | <cds-text-input kind="password"> | /        |
| check_box_tag      | <input type="checkbox"> | <cds-checkbox>                   | checkbox |
| radio_button_tag   | <input type="radio">    | <cds-radio-button>               | radio    |
| select_tag         | <select>                | <cds-select>                     | /        |
| text_area_tag      | <textarea>              | <cds-textarea>                   | textarea |
| file_field_tag     | <input type="file">     | <cds-file-uploader>              | file     |

This table includes the main helpers, with form helpers like `text_field_tag` used for tag-based forms, and notes the unexpected detail for `image_tag`, where there’s no direct CDS component, relying on standard HTML.

#### Considerations and Limitations

- **JavaScript Imports**: Users must ensure Carbon components are imported in `app/javascript/application.js` using import maps, e.g., `import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/button/index.js';`, as this is crucial for functionality but outside the mapping scope.
- **Form Builder Helpers**: For model forms, helpers like `f.text_field` (on a form builder) would map similarly, but the table uses tag helpers for consistency, as they’re more direct. The user can extend mappings for form builders based on this.
- **Accessibility**: Carbon components include built-in accessibility features, like labels for `<cds-text-input>`, which might differ from standard Rails, requiring adjustments in helper implementation, as noted in earlier discussions.
- **Scalability**: The mappings cover common helpers, but for less frequent components, users can use `carbon_tag` directly, maintaining flexibility, as seen in the user’s previous approach.

#### Unexpected Detail: Image Handling

An interesting aspect is that `image_tag` maps to standard `<img>`, with no direct CDS web component, unlike form elements. This means images in BOS would use standard HTML, possibly styled with Carbon utility classes, which is different from the component-based approach for interactive elements, requiring additional CSS work for consistency.

#### Conclusion

The table maps Rails view helpers to CDS web components and standard HTML elements, covering button, link, form input, and asset helpers, with an unexpected detail for `image_tag` lacking a direct CDS component. This mapping supports the user’s goal of integrating Carbon into BOS with clean, standard view code, ensuring consistency and elegance, as desired.

## where shall `npm install @carbon/web-components` be run in?

### Key Points

- It seems likely that `npm install @carbon/web-components` should be run in the root directory of your Rails project, typically `appname/`, where `package.json` is located.
- Research suggests this is standard practice for managing JavaScript dependencies in Rails, ensuring compatibility with tools like Webpacker or import maps.
- An unexpected detail is that while subdirectories like `app/javascript/` manage JavaScript files, `npm install` must still be run from the root for proper package management.

### Direct Answer

#### Where to Run `npm install @carbon/web-components`

Run `npm install @carbon/web-components` in the **root directory** of your Rails project, typically denoted as `appname/`. This is where the `package.json` file is located, which is essential for managing JavaScript dependencies.

#### Why the Root Directory?

Rails projects have a standard structure, and the root directory (e.g., `myapp/`) contains key files like `Gemfile` and `package.json`. Running `npm install` here ensures the package is installed in the `node_modules/` directory at the root, making it accessible for your application. Subdirectories like `app/`, `app/assets/`, or `javascripts/` (if used) are for specific code, not for running `npm install`.

#### Supporting Details

- Ensure your Rails project is set up for JavaScript, using import maps (common in Rails 7 and likely Rails 8) or Webpacker. For example, check [Carbon Web Components npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40carbon/web-components) for installation details.
- This approach aligns with standard practices, as seen in Rails guides and community discussions, ensuring compatibility with your BOS project’s needs.

### Comprehensive Analysis of Where to Run `npm install @carbon/web-components` in a Rails Project

This note provides a detailed examination of where to run the command `npm install @carbon/web-components` in a Rails project, addressing the user’s query about specific directories like `appname/app`, `appname/app/assets`, or `appname/javascripts`, in the context of their Business Operating System (BOS) project developed in Ruby on Rails 8. The analysis confirms the standard practice, outlines the reasoning, and addresses potential misconceptions, aligning with the user’s preference for simplicity and elegance.

#### Background and Context

The user is developing BOS, an enterprise application system encompassing functions like ERP, CRM, and MRP, using Ruby on Rails 8, with a preference for vanilla features, including Stimulus, Hotwire, and vanilla CSS, avoiding SCSS and heavy JavaScript frameworks. They are integrating IBM’s Carbon Design System, specifically its Web Components, and previously discussed managing JavaScript dependencies. The current query seeks to determine where to run `npm install @carbon/web-components`, listing options like `appname/app`, `appname/app/assets`, `appname/javascripts`, or elsewhere, likely to inform their project setup.

#### Analysis of Directory Structure and Installation Location

From the search results, it’s evident that in a Rails project, `npm install` is used to manage JavaScript dependencies, and the command must be run from the directory containing `package.json`, which is typically the root of the project. Let’s break down the reasoning:

- **Standard Rails Project Structure**: A typical Rails project, created with `rails new myapp`, has a root directory (e.g., `myapp/`) containing files like `Gemfile`, `config.ru`, and `package.json`. Subdirectories include:
	- `app/`: For application code (controllers, models, views).
	- `app/assets/`: For asset files (CSS, JavaScript, images), though JavaScript management has shifted in modern Rails.
	- `app/javascript/`: In Rails 6 and 7, this is where JavaScript files are placed, especially with Webpacker or import maps, but it’s not where `npm install` is run.
	- The user mentioned `appname/javascripts`, which might be a typo or reference to older Rails versions (pre-Rails 6), where `app/assets/javascripts/` was common, but still, `npm install` is run from the root.

- **Where `package.json` Is Located**: The `package.json` file, required for `npm` to manage dependencies, is located in the root directory of the Rails project. This is confirmed by multiple sources:
	- The first result from Stack Overflow discusses using `npm` packages in Rails, implying `npm install` is run from the root, where `package.json` is.
	- The GitHub repository for `npm-pipeline-rails` suggests `npm` is used at the project level, reinforcing the root directory.
	- The Medium post on installing `nvm`, `node`, and `yarn` for Rails also indicates setup at the project root.
	- The NodeSource guide and SitePoint article on `npm` discuss `package.json` at the project root, aligning with Rails practices.
	- The DEV Community post on Yarn (similar to `npm`) mentions running `yarn init` from the project root, further supporting this.

- **Why Not Subdirectories?**: The user listed options like `appname/app`, `appname/app/assets`, and `appname/javascripts`. Let’s analyze:
	- `appname/app`: This is for application code (e.g., controllers, views), not for managing dependencies. Running `npm install` here would fail without `package.json`.
	- `appname/app/assets`: This is for asset files, and while older Rails versions used `app/assets/javascripts/` for JavaScript, `npm install` is still run from the root. In modern Rails, `app/assets/` is more for Sprockets, not `npm`.
	- `appname/javascripts`: This might be a typo for `app/javascript/`, but even then, it’s a subdirectory for JavaScript files, not for running `npm install`. The `node_modules/` directory, where packages are installed, is at the root.

- **Carbon Web Components Specifics**: For `@carbon/web-components`, the installation is via `npm`, as seen in the npm page and GitHub repository. The documentation likely recommends `npm install @carbon/web-components`, and from the search results, it’s clear this is run from the project root. For example:
	- The npm page for `@carbon/web-components` states “Start using @carbon/web-components in your project by running `npm i @carbon/web-components`,” implying from the root.
	- The Carbon Design System site mentions setting up a module bundler, which requires the package to be installed via `npm`, again from the root.

- **Rails 8 Considerations**: Since the current time is March 22, 2025, and Rails 8 is hypothetical, we can assume it follows similar patterns to Rails 7, where import maps are default, but `npm` is still used for packages like `@carbon/web-components`. The project structure remains with `package.json` at the root.

#### Table: Directory Options and Suitability for `npm install`

| Directory Option      | Suitability for `npm install` | Reason                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appname/` (root)     | Yes                           | Contains `package.json`, standard location for managing dependencies. |
| `appname/app`         | No                            | For application code, no `package.json` here.                |
| `appname/app/assets`  | No                            | For asset files, not for running `npm install`.              |
| `appname/javascripts` | No                            | Likely a typo for `app/javascript/`, still a subdirectory, not root. |

#### Practical Usage in BOS

For BOS, running `npm install @carbon/web-components` in the root ensures the package is available for use in views, especially with the custom helpers discussed earlier. Ensure your Rails project is set up for JavaScript, and check [Carbon Web Components npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40carbon/web-components) for any specific setup instructions.

```bash
cd appname
npm init -y   # (if package.json doesn't exist yet)
npm install -S @carbon/web-components # 
```

The -S flag stands for **--save**, which:

​	•	Adds the installed package (in this case, @carbon/web-components) to the dependencies section of your package.json file.

-y **Skips all questions** and creates a basic package.json immediately with default value
